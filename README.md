# Maze
A collection of procedural maze generation and solving algorithms in Python. Includes Binary Tree and Sidewinder generators, with Dijkstra pathfinding and image export support.

The main reference books is 《Mazes for Programmers》, the book only give codes for Ruby, so I want to trans Ruby to python.
