A collection of procedural maze generation and solving algorithms implemented in Python.  
This project includes **Binary Tree** and **Sidewinder** maze generators, along with **Dijkstra pathfinding** and PNG image export.

## Python Version & Installation

- **Python version**: `3.8.6` (or higher)
- **Required library**: `Pillow` for PNG rendering

To install dependencies:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```
---
## How to run
There are two project files included.
Simply unzip the folder and run:
```bash
python demo.py
```

This will generate:
* One text-based maze displayed in your terminal (using ASCII characters)
* One image-based maze saved as a PNG file (longest_path.png)

The main reference books is 《Mazes for Programmers》, the book only give codes for Ruby, so I want to trans Ruby to python.
